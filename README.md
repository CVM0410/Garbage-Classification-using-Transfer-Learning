# Garbage-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Garbage Classification project using Transfer Learning. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to enhance waste management systems by accurately classifying different types of waste using the EfficientNetV2S model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.

## Project Overview
Effective waste management is crucial for environmental sustainability. This project addresses the challenge by applying advanced machine learning techniques to classify waste more accurately and efficiently. Using a transfer learning approach with the EfficientNetV2S model allows the system to perform high-accuracy classification even with limited data.

## Features
High Accuracy: Achieved a classification accuracy of 97.03%, significantly enhancing the capability to segregate different waste types.
Advanced Model: Utilizes EfficientNetV2S, known for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling diverse image processing tasks.
Robust Dataset Handling: Includes preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to prepare the data for training.
